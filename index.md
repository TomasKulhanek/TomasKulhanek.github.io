I'm software developer with a special focus on scientific software. 

In the past I focused on the modeling methodologies and integrating algorithm and simulation computation into grid and cloud computing. I've used and developed for these backend technologies (.NET and [ServiceStack](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack), Java and [Spring](https://spring.io/)) and frontend technologies (HTML5, pure Javascript and JQuery, recently on ECMAScript 6 and [Aurelia](https://aurelia.io) ). 

I have been covering these scientific domains: computational physiology, integrative structural biology, psychoacoustic and auditory perception research.
